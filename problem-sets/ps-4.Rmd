## Exercises from the book

**8.1**: 1, 3

**8.2**: 2, 3 (use R), 4 (can use a cdf for the probability calculation), 13

**8.4**: 3

For 8.2.3, some useful functions include: `stat_function()`, `dchisq()`, `geom_hline()`, and `qchisq()` (to find the medians).

<!-- ## Case Study: German Tank Problem -->

<!-- Let's pick up the example that we began in class but make the simplifying assumption that we're studying a process where our sample is drawn from the continuous distribution, $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n \sim \textrm{Unif}(0, \theta)$, but we're still interested in estimating $\theta$. The MLE and Method of Moments estimators are the same: -->

<!-- $$\begin{aligned} -->
<!-- \hat{\theta}_{MLE} &= \textrm{max}(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n) = X_{max} \\ -->
<!-- \hat{\theta}_{MOM} &= 2 \bar{X} \\ -->
<!-- \end{aligned}$$ -->

<!-- 1. Calculate the Bias What happens in the asymptote? -->

<!-- The pdf of $X_{max}$ is $nF^{n - 1}(x)f(x). -->

<!-- 2. Calculate the Variance What happens in the asymptote? -->

<!-- 3. Simulate and do ggridges plot to show convergence/consistency -->
